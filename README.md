MobileDetect is a CFC port of the Mobile_Detect PHP Library which was originally authored by
Victor Stanciu <vic.stanciu@gmail.com> and is now currently authored by
Serban Ghita <serbanghita@gmail.com> and Nick Ilyin <nick.ilyin@gmail.com>.

Their project is on GitHub and can be seen here
https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect

The site for their project is
http://mobiledetect.net/

I've used this library in various PHP projects and decided to port it over to be able to use
in my ColdFusion Projects.

The library is used for detecting mobile devices (including tablets)
It uses the UserAgent string combined with specific HTTP headers to detect the mobile environment.

This current version is based on their 2.8.11 release
